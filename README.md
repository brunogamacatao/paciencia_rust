# Solitaire game built in Rust

This is a toy project, built while I was in vacation, in order to learn rust programming language and its pretty weird features like borrowing, ownership, lifetimes...

It's a whole new world for a Java/Python/C programmer, used to garbage collectors or explicit memory allocation.

## Dependencies

* SDL2
* SDL2 Image

## Running

`cargo run`

## Building the Release Binary

`cargo build --release`

## General Considerations

I am trying not to use fancy libraries, such as specs, because I'm trying to learn the language itself and not get used, from the beginning, to rely on them.
